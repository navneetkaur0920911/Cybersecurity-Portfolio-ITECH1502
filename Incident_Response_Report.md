# Incident Response Process ‚Äì TryHackMe Activity

## üß† Overview
This document summarizes my practical learning experience from completing the **Incident Response Process** room on TryHackMe.  
The activity simulated a real-world cyber incident in which I played the role of a **Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst** tasked with managing and resolving a potential compromise on a Windows workstation.

## üîç Methodology
1. **Registration:** Logged into TryHackMe using my FedUni email for verification.  
2. **Room Selection:** Joined the ‚ÄúIncident Response Process‚Äù room.  
3. **Task Completion:** Worked through six structured modules:
   - Task 1: Introduction  
   - Task 2: Incident Response Lifecycle  
   - Task 3: Detection and Analysis  
   - Task 4: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery  
   - Task 5: Closing the Cycle  
   - Task 6: Conclusion  
4. **Learning Focus:** Applied the **NIST Incident Response Framework** to analyze each stage.  
5. **Evidence:** Screenshots were taken for all completed tasks to verify successful completion.

## üß© Tools and Concepts Explored
- **SIEM systems** for detection and alerting  
- **Wireshark** for traffic analysis (conceptual)  
- **Volatility Framework** for memory analysis  
- **Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST 800-61r2)**  
- **Post-Incident Review** for organizational learning

## üìä Results and Outcomes
All tasks were completed successfully, demonstrating understanding of:
- The **four NIST phases** (Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, Post-Incident).  
- The importance of incident documentation and lessons learned.  
- The critical role of teamwork, communication, and preparation in mitigating cyber risks.



## üìò Summary
This exercise reinforced the concept that cybersecurity is not a single product or tool, but an **ongoing process** of prevention, detection, and response.  
I developed a clearer understanding of how security teams operate during an incident and how a well-defined response plan minimizes operational impact and recovery time.
