# Learning Reflection

## 🌐 Reflection on the Incident Response Process
Completing the TryHackMe “Incident Response Process” activity provided an excellent opportunity to apply cybersecurity theory to a practical, scenario-based environment.  
I gained valuable insight into the **NIST Incident Response Framework** and its stages — from preparation to post-incident analysis.

The activity emphasized that cybersecurity incidents must be handled with a structured and calm approach, prioritizing evidence collection, threat containment, and documentation. I learned how every incident provides new lessons that contribute to improving organizational resilience.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Incident response is a **continuous lifecycle**, not a one-time event.  
- Preparation and planning reduce confusion during actual incidents.  
- Communication within the Incident Response Team is critical for success.  
- Documentation supports future prevention strategies and audit readiness.  

## 🚀 Personal Development
This project strengthened my confidence in handling cybersecurity incidents and enhanced my ability to think like a security analyst. It also encouraged me to continue exploring related tools such as **Wireshark**, **Volatility**, and **SIEM platforms** to deepen my practical expertise.
